# Docker configuration for Kandinsky-2 (CPU)

This is a Docker configuration for [Kandinsky-2](https://github.com/ai-forever/Kandinsky-2) with some changes to make 
it work on CPU. Take into account that this is a very slow solution, so it will take a lot of time to complete. 
Require at least 16GB of RAM (swap) for me to work. See Dockerfile for more details.

```bash
docker-compose up
```
